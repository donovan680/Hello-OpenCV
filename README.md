# Hello-OpenCV
OpenCV (C++) for Computer Vision projects.
OpenCV is a primary tool for developing computer vision applications. 

I have prototyped a lot in MATLAB, but except on one occasion the production version has always been OpenCV based. 

Let’s look at the pros and cons.

Why should you use OpenCV (C++) for Computer Vision : The Pros

1- It’s free! : Large parts of OpenCV are free — i.e. free as in beer, and free as in speech! You can use OpenCV freely in your commercial application, and you can view the source and fix issues if needed. You do not have to open source your project if you use OpenCV.

2- Huge optimized library : The collection of algorithms available in OpenCV dwarfs everything out there. The library is also optimized for performance. With OpenCV 3, you can use the Transparent API to easily use OpenCL compliant devices (e.g. GPU) on your machine. Many algorithms have a CUDA implementation.

3- Platforms and devices : You can obviously use OpenCV in your desktop app or as the backend of your web application. Because of its focus on performance OpenCV (C/C++) is the vision library of choice in many embedded vision applications and mobile apps.

4- Big community : There is a big community of developers (47,000 or so) that use and support OpenCV. It has been downloaded more than 9 Million times. Unlike the MATLAB community that consists of researchers, the OpenCV community is a mix of people from many fields and industries. The OpenCV development is funded by companies like Intel, AMD & Google. Needless to say, this blog is part of this vibrant community of people who are trying to help each other.
